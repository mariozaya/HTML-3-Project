	<li> Squats: (This exercise will help the lower back, core, legs, glutes, and many more areas of the body. The premise of this exercise is to lower your body downwards towards the ground like you are sitting in a chair without raising your legs. You also have to make sure that your back is straight at all times.). </li>
	<li> Bench Press: (This exercise helps you build more strength in your arms, core, and chest. The premise of this workout is to grab the bar, lift it up. Then slowly drop the bar slightly above your chest. Then you have to push the bar up so your arms are fully extended but not locked. Afterwards, you repeat the process with more or less weights depending on the workout.). </li>
	<li> Weighted Calf Raises: (This exercise helps you build more strength in your legs and calves. The premise of this workout is to grab some weights and raise your body using your legs. The goal is to be raised enough to the point where you donâ€™t jump but also feel it in your legs. Afterwards, you will slowly decline your feet back to ground level and repeat the exercise again.). </li>
